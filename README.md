# RSS Blog Aggregator

This is a CLI application to track and aggregate various RSS feeds.

## Tech Used

The technologies I used (and learned in some cases) for this project are:

1. **Golang**
2. A **PostgreSQL** database
3. **Goose** for database migrations
4. **SQLC** to generate queries (for more control rather than an ORM)
